	<summary>Overview - Getting Started</summary>
	<p>This dashboard provides a way to review what has changed between Versions (or just do a back up) of Enterprise Security Content Update.
	</p>
	<P>The query linked below will use the rest interface and generate a CSV file with all. the Saved Searches on the system. </P>
	<p> The below panels will then present the differences between the two .csv files selected above. In the ‘Details’ panel, a '1' in the Count field means it is new, or removed. The other fields with "[field] Count" stand for distinct count: of that field; these will be either 2 or 1. This means the field Changed, or didn't change. </p>
	<P>

	<b>In order to get this to work properly</b>, you should run the below linked query twice - once before and once after applying the update. Running it just before applying the update will make sure you've captured any changes made since the last time the query was run.</P>

	<summary>Filtering</summary>
	<p>Select the available source file descriptions you want to compare. The analytics will run on Submit.</p>
	<p>Not all Searches may be appropriate - use "Title Exclude" to bulk exclude some searches based on a term in the title.
	Multiple terms should be pipe (|) seperated. Don't use Azure? Exclude those here. Don't use Azure, AWS or Office 365? Use the "|" pipe to seperate the exclude terms: "Azure|0365|AWS" etc.</p>
	<p>Specific types of changes can be filtered for with "Only ‘these changes"</p>

	<p>You can filter the "Details" panel by clicking on a title in the "Rollup" panel. After you've selected one, you can directly select a‘different one from the "Rollup" OR reset to all titles using the Title Token Reset radio button. </p>
